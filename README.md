4. **Optimize Skill Development üöÄ**: Identify the most optimal skills for job seekers to develop in order to enhance their employability and earning potential.

By achieving these objectives, our project aims to empower individuals and organizations with the knowledge needed to make informed decisions in the ever-evolving field of data analytics.

## Background:
This data has been collected from this source. [Data Source](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)üìä

I've designed and implemented a relational database to store and analyze job posting data. The database is structured to provide insights into job trends, required skills, and salary information.
The project uses four primary tables to organize and analyze the data:

- **company_dim**: Contains details about companies, including company ID, name, and links.
- **skills_dim**: Stores information about skills, including skill ID, name, and type.
- **job_postings_fact**: Captures job postings data with fields such as job ID, company ID, job title, location, posted date, and salary information.
- **skills_job_dim**: A junction table linking jobs and skills with job ID and skill ID as foreign keys.

The relational database can be visualised using the table schemas below:

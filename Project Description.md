## Background:
This data has been collected from this source. [Data Source](https://www.lukebarousse.com/sql)üìä

I've designed and implemented a relational database to store and analyze job posting data. The database is structured to provide insights into job trends, required skills, and salary information.
The project uses four primary tables to organize and analyze the data:

- **company_dim**: Contains details about companies, including company ID, name, and links.
- **skills_dim**: Stores information about skills, including skill ID, name, and type.
- **job_postings_fact**: Captures job postings data with fields such as job ID, company ID, job title, location, posted date, and salary information.
- **skills_job_dim**: A junction table linking jobs and skills with job ID and skill ID as foreign keys.

The relational database can be visualised using the table schemas below:

    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact jpf
JOIN company_dim cd ON jpf.company_id = cd.company_id
GROUP BY jpf.company_id, name
ORDER BY num_jobs DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
